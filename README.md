Interesting problems that were worked on for UW AMATH 583 - High Performance Scientific Computing. 

Includes: 
1. Strassen Matrix Multiplication Algorithm
   - After intially having a matrix multiplication computation time of about 2.5 minutes for large matrices, some adjustments were made and I brought the computation time down to ~4 seconds for two 512 X 512 sized matrices.
3. Multi-threaded Game of Life implementation
4. Threaded Elevator Simulator
